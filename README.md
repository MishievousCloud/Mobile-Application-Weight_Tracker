# Mobile-Application-Weight_Tracker
A simple mobile application for android that tracks your weight daily.

*** Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address? ***

The goals of this app were to develop a fully functional login and registration screen, store data using an SQLite database and display user entered weights to the users screen that can be created, updated, deleted, viewed, and to include an SMS messaging system that alert the user upon reaching their weight goal. This app is designed for people who want to keep track of their weight for fitness, health, or personal reasons using a simple yet functional design.

*** What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful? ***

A login and registration screen, A display screen for the stored data entered by the user, login and weight tracking data using an SQLite database, SMS messaging notifications, the ability to modify and delete the data entered into the database, and the ability to disable and enable notifications. I kept the user in mind during the UI design to provide a clean yet functional look that follows the same color scheme throughout and provides the user an easy to understand and pick up ability to track their weights. I believe my design was susccessful in that it retains the functionality without suffering in the UI elements and layouts throughout the application and is not overly complicated. The user can easily move from one screen to the next with no difficulty.

*** How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future? ***

I approached the coding process by getting an early start on coding the first screens that the user would encounter by developing the login and registration screens first. Once this was finished I moved on to creating the database that would be needed to store the user entered information. Once that was complete I included the SMS messagin system to link to the features that were needed to notify the user. I made sure to build and test the application often to verify that the code was functioning as it should and provided in line comments to not lose track of what and how parts of my code functions. This way an outsider can see the source code and understand what is happening. I plan to do the same in my strategies for coding in the future to effectively write code that is easy to understand and avoid potential bugs along the way through verifying the app works often.

*** How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal? ***

I ran the application and attempted every possibly thing that should break the app or cause errors as often as I could to prevent any errors upon releasing the app. This was my own bug testing and I put code in place to counter any potential errors. It revealed that a lot of things can go wrong if a user were to enter information incorectly or forget to fill in fields.

*** Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge? ***

When it came time to include the display, update, and delete features of the mobile app I ran into some issues and had to change a lot of my code to get it working properly. Some aspects of the design tat I had in mind had to be scrapped and changed out for a different design that would work simply because I could not get the app to function the way I originally had in mind. This was challenging to come across because what I thought possible was not likely to work in code.

*** In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience? ***

I think I was able to successfully implement the login and registration features to the best of my abilities and they function wonderfully. I even took the time to create a much better layout that is appealing and includes visual elements that help the user understand the purpose of certain views. I know that with time and effort comes experience and I look forward to continuing my journey in software development.
